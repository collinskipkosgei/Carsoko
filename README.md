# Carsokoni (Frontend Demo)

This is a frontend-only React + Redux demo implementing the Carsokoni project requirements.
- Local data store: `src/data/carsData.js` (20 sample cars, prices in KES)
- Redux slices for cars, cart and user (mock auth)
- Tailwind CSS + small custom CSS for animations

## Quick start
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

Demo login credentials (mock):
- email: test@carsoko.co.ke
- password: password123

Notes:
- `node_modules` not included in the zip. If you want, I can also produce a GitHub repo structure.
